         <span class="style7">The De La Salle University-Dasmariñas was first established 
         on July 18, 1977 as a private nonsectarian tertiary school named General Emilio 
         Aguinaldo College (GEAC)- Cavite and managed by the Yaman Lahi Foundation in 
         Dasmariñas, Cavite.Currently, degree programs for the College of Liberal Arts, 
         Science, Business Administration and Education are bestowed Level IV 
         accreditation by the Federation of Accrediting Agencies in the Philippines based 
         on the recommendation of the Philippine Accrediting Association of Schools, 
         Colleges and Universities (PAASCU) which is testament to the school&#39;s excellent 
         curriculum and teaching practices. In the immediate future, the De La Salle 
         University - Dasmariñas intends to achieve excellence in regional studies and 
         academic programs relevant to the needs of the CALABARZON area. This will be 
         addressed through adopting quality and effective instruction exerted by 
         competent faculty members. Moreover, it aims to produce graduates who are 
         globally competitive and to earn further distinction in board examinations. To 
         strengthen research on Cavite studies,a museum has been constructed to house 
         Cavite historical treasures and to generate research outputs on Cavite history 
         and culture.</span><br />
